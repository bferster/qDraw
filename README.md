# qDraw
SVG vector drawing tool

qDraw is a simple, easy to use web-based vector drawing and annotation tool, but with advanced features typically found in desktop drawing packages. It is completely written in JavaScript and requires no plugs to be added to a website. Internally qDraw uses SVG to draw and store the drawings with direct saving and loading to your Google Docs account.
